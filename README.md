# VulnerablePHPapp
The vulnerable PHP project is a deliberately insecure web application created for educational purposes, specifically designed to showcase common security vulnerabilities in a controlled environment. In this project, we have simulated a simplified travel agency scenario, including a login and registration system. The intentional inclusion of security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection and XSS, allows users to gain hands-on experience in identifying, exploiting, and mitigating these risks.

Features:

Login and Registration System: The project includes a basic login and registration system for users to interact with the web application.

Simulated Vulnerabilities: Deliberate vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS exploitation, and potentially insecure file uploads, have been intentionally incorporated into the project. These vulnerabilities serve as educational examples to help users understand the risks associated with poor coding practices.

Educational Focus: The primary purpose of the vulnerable PHP project is educational. Users can learn about common web application security issues, understand how these vulnerabilities can be exploited, and practice implementing countermeasures to enhance the application's security.

Responsible Use: It is crucial to emphasize that any testing or exploration of vulnerabilities within this project should be conducted ethically and responsibly. Users are encouraged to use the project for educational purposes only and in environments where they have explicit permission to do so.

Note: This project is not intended for deployment in a production environment. The vulnerabilities included are for educational purposes, and the project should not be used for malicious activities. Always adhere to ethical guidelines and legal boundaries when engaging with security testing and learning initiatives.
